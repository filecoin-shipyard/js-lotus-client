# Introduction

The [Lotus JS Client](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client) is a collection of small JavaScript libraries that you can use to communicate with the [Lotus implementation](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus) of [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) via it's JSON-RPC API.

The Lotus daemons exposes JSON-RPC methods via HTTP and WebSockets that can be called from any language. Applications and websites written in JavaScript can make calls to the endpoints directly using the raw JSON-RPC API, or they can use these libraries to make accessing the APIs more convenient and ergonomic from common JavaScript environments.
